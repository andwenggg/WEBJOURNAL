              <h3>What is Augmented Reality? (AU)?</h3>
              <p>
                The fundamental idea of AR is to combine, or mix, the view of the real environment with 
additional, virtual content that is presented through computer graphics. Its convincing effect is 
achieved by ensuring that the virtual content is aligned and registered with the real objects. As a 
person moves in an environment and their perspective view of real objects changes, the virtual 
content should also be presented from the same perspective.

          <h2>AUGMENTED REALITY</h2>
          <br>
          <p>Augmented reality (AR) is a form of emerging technology that allows users to overlay computer-generated content in the real world. AR refers to a live view of a physical real-world environment 
            whose elements are merged with augmented computer-generated images creating a mixed reality. 
            Augmented Reality (AR) as a real-time direct or indirect view of a physical real-world 
            environment that has been enhanced/augmented by adding virtual computer-generated 
            information to it.
            Augmented reality is the integration of digital information with the user's environment in real-time. Unlike virtual reality, which creates a totally artificial environment, augmented reality uses 
            the existing environment and overlays new information on top of it. A live direct or indirect view 
            of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are augmented by computer-generated 
            sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data.  </p>

        <h2>VIRTUAL REALITY</h2>
        <br>
        <p>VR is fully immersive, which tricks your senses into thinking you’re in a different environment or 
          world apart from the real world. Using a head-mounted display (HMD) or headset, you’ll 
          experience a computer-generated world of imagery and sounds in which you can manipulate 
          objects and move around using haptic controllers while tethered to a console or PC.It is also called
          a computer-simulated reality. It refers to computer technologies using reality headsets to generate 
          realistic sounds, images and other sensations that replicate a real environment or create an 
          imaginary world. </p>

      <h2>MIXED REALITY</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Mixed Reality (MR), sometimes referred to as hybrid reality, is the merging of real and virtual 
        worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist 
        and interact in real-time. It means placing new imagery within a real space in such a way that the 
        new imagery is able to interact, to an extent, with what is real in the physical world we know.   In mixed reality, you interact with and manipulate both physical and virtual items and 
        environments, using next-generation sensing and imaging technologies. MR allows you to see and 
        immerse yourself in the world around you even as you interact with a virtual environment using 
        your own hands—all without ever removing your headset. </p>

            Processing Unit, and <br>(3) Visual Unit.<br> The
            Infrastructure Tracker Unit was responsible for
            collecting data from the real world, sending them to
            the Processing Unit, which mixed the virtual
            content with the real content and sent the result to
            the Video Out module of the Visual Unit.<br> Some

        <li>AR In Education - AR can be used to enhance content 
          and instruction within the traditional classroom, supplement instruction in the special education 
          classroom, extend content into the world outside the classroom, and be combined with other 
          technologies to enrich their individual applications</li>

        <li>AR In Medicine - Augmented reality has the 
          potential to play a big role in improving the healthcare industry. Only a few years since the first 
          implementations of augmented reality in medicine, it has already filled an important place in 
          doctors’ and nurses’ routine, as well as patients’ lives.
          </li>
        <li>AR In Entertainment - Augmented reality can be used in various “entertainment” industries as entertainment covers quite 
          a number of different industries – music, movies, live shows, games – and all of them can benefit 
          from using augmented reality.
