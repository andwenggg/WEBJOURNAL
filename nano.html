              <h3>What is Emerging Technologies?</h4>
              <p>
                Emerging technologies are technologies whose development, practical applications, or both are still largely unrealized. These technologies are generally new but also include older technologies finding new applications. Emerging technologies are often perceived as capable of changing the status quo.

                            Society meeting at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech) on December 29, 1959, long 
                            before the term nanotechnology was used. In his talk, Feynman (see Figure 7.1) described a process 
                            in which scientists would be able to manipulate and control individual atoms and molecules. Over 
                            a decade later, in his explorations of ultraprecision machining, Professor Norio Taniguchi coined 
                            the term nanotechnology. It wasn't until 1981, with the development of the scanning tunneling 
                            microscope that could "see" individual atoms, that modern nanotechnology began.</p>.</th>

            <h1>BIOTECHNOLOGY</h1>
            <p>Biotechnology is technology based on biology - biotechnology harnesses cellular and biomolecular processes to develop technologies and products that help improve our lives and the health of our planet. We have used the biological processes of microorganisms for more than 6,000 years to make useful food products, such as bread and cheese, and to preserve dairy products. 
              Today, biotechnology covers many different disciplines (e.g. genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, etc.). New technologies and products are developed every year within the areas of e.g. Medicine (development of new medicines and therapies), agriculture (development of genetically modified plants, biofuels, biological treatment) or industrial biotechnology (production of chemicals, paper, textiles, and food).

      <h1>BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY</h1>
      <p>	Originally blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptography hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree).
        A blockchain is, in the simplest of terms, a time-stamped series of immutable records of data that is managed by a cluster of computers not owned by any single entity. Each of these blocks of data (i.e. block) is secured and bound to each other using cryptographic principles (i.e. chain).
      </p>
      <img src="block.webp"width="700" height="400">
    </div>

    <div class="bchistory">
      <h2>HISTORY OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The first work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta. They wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with.</li>
        <li>In 1992, Bayer, Haber, and Stornetta incorporated Merkle trees to the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.
        </li>
        <li>The first blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using the Hash cash like the method to add blocks to the chain without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party.
        </li>
        <li>In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB (Gigabyte). In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size.
        </li>
        <li>The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper but were eventually popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="pillars">
      <h2>The Three Pillars of Blockchain Technology </h2>
      <ol type="1">
        <li><i><b>Decentralization</b></i></li>
          <ul>
            <li>In a decentralized system the information is not stored by one single entity. In fact, everyone in the network owns the information. </li>
            <li>In a decentralized network ,if you wanted to interact with your friend then you can do so directly without going through a third party. That was the main ideology behind Bitcoins. You and only you alone are in charge of your money. You can send your money to anyone you want without having to go through a bank.</li>  
          </ul>
        <li><i><b>Transparency </b></i></li>
          <ul>
            <li> One of the most interesting and misunderstood concepts in blockchain technology is “transparency.” Some people say that blockchain gives you privacy while some say that it is transparent. Why do you think that happens? </li>
            <li>A person’s identity is hidden via complex cryptography and represented only by their public address. So, if you were to look up a person’s transaction history, you will not see “Bob sent 1 BTC” instead you will see “1MF1bhsFLkBzzz9vpFYEmvwT2TbyCt7NZJ sent 1 BTC”. </li>
            <li>So, while the person’s real identity is secure, you will still see all the transactions that were done by their public address. This level of transparency has never existed before within a financial system. It adds that extra, and much needed, level of accountability which is required by some of these biggest institutions. </li>
          </ul>
        <li><i><b>Immutability</b></i></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Immutability, in the context of the blockchain, means that once something has been entered into the blockchain, it cannot be tampered with.</li>
            <li>The reason why the blockchain gets this property is that of the cryptographic hash function. </li>
            <li> In simple terms, hashing means taking an input string of any length and giving out an output of a fixed length.</li>
          </ul>
