              <h3>What is Data Science?</h3>
              <p>
                Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and 
                systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.
                Data science is much more than simply analyzing data. It offers a range of roles and requires a 
                range of skills.

    <h2>Data</h2>
    <div class="containerds">
      <p>- Data can be defined as a representation of facts, concepts, or instructions in a formalized manner, 
        which should be suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing, by human or electronic 
        machines. It can be described as unprocessed facts and figures. It is represented with the help of 
        characters such as alphabets (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9) or special characters (+, -, /, *, <,>, =, etc.). </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Information</h2>
    <div class="containerds">
      <p>- Information is the processed data on which decisions and actions are based. It is data that 
        has been processed into a form that is meaningful to the recipient and is of real or perceived value 
        in the current or the prospective action or decision of recipient. Furtherer more, information is 
        interpreted data; created from organized, structured, and processed data in a particular context.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<section id="process">
  <div class="process">
    <h2>Data Processing Cycle</h2>
    <p>Data processing is the re-structuring or re-ordering of data by people or machines to increase their 
      usefulness and add values for a particular purpose. Data processing consists of the following basic
      steps - input, processing, and output. These three steps constitute the data processing cycle.</p>
    <img src="dpc.png" width="500">
    <ul>
      <li><i><b>Input</b></i> − in this step, the input data is prepared in some convenient form for processing. The 
        form will depend on the processing machine.</li>
      <li><i><b>Processing </b></i>− in this step, the input data is changed to produce data in a more useful form. </li>
      <li><i><b>Output</b></i> − at this stage, the result of the proceeding processing step is collected. The 
        particular form of the output data depends on the use of the data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Types and their representation</h2>
    <h4>Data types from Computer programming perspective</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><i><b>Integers(int)</b></i>- is used to store whole numbers, mathematically known as integers.</li>
        <li><i><b>Booleans(bool)</b></i>- is used to represent restricted to one of two values: true or false.</li>
        <li><i><b>Characters(char)</b></i>- is used to store a single character.</li>
        <li><i><b> Floating-point numbers(float)</b></i>- is used to store real numbers.</li>
        <li><i><b> Alphanumeric strings(string)</b></i>- used to store a combination of characters and numbers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Data types from Data Analytics perspective</h4>
      <img src="img.png" width="500">
     <h5><b>Structured Data</b></h5>
      <p>Structured data is data that adheres to a pre-defined data model and is therefore straightforward to 
        analyze. Structured data conforms to a tabular format with a relationship between the different 
        rows and columns. Common examples of structured data are Excel files or SQL databases. Each 
        of these has structured rows and columns that can be sorted.</p>
    <h5><b>Semi-structured Data</b></h5>
    <p>Semi-structured data is a form of structured data that does not conform with the formal structure 
      of data models associated with relational databases or other forms of data tables, but nonetheless, 
      contains tags or other markers to separate semantic elements and enforce hierarchies of records 
      and fields within the data. Therefore, it is also known as a self-describing structure. Examples of 
      semi-structured data include JSON and XML are forms of semi-structured data.
      </p>
    <h5><b>Unstructured Data</b></h5>
    <p>Unstructured data is information that either does not have a predefined data model or is not 
      organized in a pre-defined manner. Unstructured information is typically text-heavy but may 
      contain data such as dates, numbers, and facts as well. This results in irregularities and ambiguities 
      that make it difficult to understand using traditional programs as compared to data stored in 
      structured databases. Common examples of unstructured data include audio, video files or No-SQL databases.</p>
  </div>

<section id="value">
  <div class="value">
      <h2> Data Value Chain</h2>
      <p>The Data Value Chain is introduced to describe the information flow within a big data system as 
        a series of steps needed to generate value and useful insights from data.<br> The Big Data Value Chain 
        identifies the following key high-level activities:</p>
        <img src="value.png"width="700">

        <h5><b>Data Acquisition</b></h5>
        <p>It is the process of gathering, filtering, and cleaning data before it is put in a data warehouse or any 
          other storage solution on which data analysis can be carried out. Data acquisition is one of the 
          major big data challenges in terms of infrastructure requirements. The infrastructure required to 
          support the acquisition of big data must deliver low, predictable latency in both capturing data and 
          in executing queries; be able to handle very high transaction volumes, often in a distributed 
          environment; and support flexible and dynamic data structures.</p>

        <h5><b>Data Analysis</b></h5>
        <p>It is concerned with making the raw data acquired amenable to use in decision-making as well as 
          domain-specific usage. Data analysis involves exploring, transforming, and modeling data with 
          the goal of highlighting relevant data, synthesizing and extracting useful hidden information with 
          high potential from a business point of view. Related areas include data mining, business 
          intelligence, and machine learning. </p>

        <h5><b> Data Curation</b></h5>
        <p>It is the active management of data over its life cycle to ensure it meets the necessary data quality 
          requirements for its effective usage. Data curation processes can be categorized into different 
          activities such as content creation, selection, classification, transformation, validation, and 
          preservation. Data curation is performed by expert curators that are responsible for improving the 
          accessibility and quality of data. Data curators (also known as scientific curators or data 
          annotators) hold the responsibility of ensuring that data are trustworthy, discoverable, accessible,
          reusable and fit their purpose. A key trend for the duration of big data utilizes community and 
          crowdsourcing approaches. </p>

        <h5><b>Data Storage</b></h5>
        <p>It is the persistence and management of data in a scalable way that satisfies the needs of 
          applications that require fast access to the data. Relational Database Management Systems 
          (RDBMS) have been the main, and almost unique, a solution to the storage paradigm for nearly 
          40 years. However, the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties that 
          guarantee database transactions lack flexibility with regard to schema changes and the 
          performance and fault tolerance when data volumes and complexity grow, making them unsuitable for big data scenarios. NoSQL technologies have been designed with the scalability goal in mind 
          and present a wide range of solutions based on alternative data models. </p>
        
          <h5><b>Data Usage</b></h5>
          <p>It covers the data-driven business activities that need access to data, its analysis, and the tools 
            needed to integrate the data analysis within the business activity. Data usage in business decision-making can enhance competitiveness through the reduction of costs, increased added value, or any 
            other parameter that can be measured against existing performance criteria.

      <h3>Big Data Life Cycle with Hadoop </h3>
      <ol>
        <li><i><b> Ingesting data into the system</b></i></li>
          <p>The first stage of Big Data processing is Ingest. The data is ingested or transferred to Hadoop from 
            various sources such as relational databases, systems, or local files. Sqoop transfers data from 
            RDBMS to HDFS, whereas Flume transfers event data.
            </p>
        <li><i><b>Processing the data in storage</b></i></li>
          <p>The second stage is Processing. In this stage, the data is stored and processed. The data is stored 
            in the distributed file system, HDFS, and the NoSQL distributed data, HBase. Spark and 
            MapReduce perform data processing.</p>
        <li><i><b> Computing and analyzing data</b></i></li>
          <p>The third stage is to Analyze. Here, the data is analyzed by processing frameworks such as Pig, 
            Hive, and Impala. Pig converts the data using a map and reduce and then analyzes it. Hive is also 
            based on the map and reduce programming and is most suitable for structured data.
            </p>
        <li><i><b> Visualizing the results</b></i></li>
            <p>The fourth stage is Access, which is performed by tools such as Hue and Cloudera Search. In this 
              stage, the analyzed data can be accessed by users.
