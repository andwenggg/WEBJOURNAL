              <h3>What is Internet of Things (IoT)?</h3>
              <p>
                The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects or "things" embedded 
                with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to 
                collect and exchange data. IoT is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and 
                digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability 
                to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer 
                interaction. IoT is a network of devices that can sense, accumulate and transfer data over the 
                internet without any human intervention.

          <h2>HISTORY OF IOT</h2>
          <br>
          <p>The Internet of Things has not been around for very long. However, there have been visions of 
            machines communicating with one another since the early 1800s. Machines have been providing 
            direct communications since the telegraph (the first landline) was developed in the 1830s and 
            1840s. Described as “wireless telegraphy,” the first radio voice transmission took place on June 3, 
            1900, providing another necessary component for developing the Internet of Things. The 
            development of computers began in the 1950s.
            The Internet, itself a significant component of the IoT, started out as part of DARPA (Defense 
            Advanced Research Projects Agency) in 1962 and evolved into ARPANET in 1969. In the 1980s, 
            commercial service providers began supporting public use of ARPANET, allowing it to evolve 
            into our modern Internet. Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) became a reality in early 1993, with 
            the Department of Defense providing a stable, highly functional system of 24 satellites.quickly followed by privately owned, commercial satellites being placed in orbit. Satellites and 
            landlines provide basic communications for much of the IoT. One additional and important 
            component in developing a functional IoT was IPV6’s remarkably intelligent decision to increase 
            address space. 
            The Internet of Things, as a concept, wasn’t officially named until 1999.<br><br> One of the first examples 
            of an Internet of Things is from the early 1980s and was a Coca Cola machine, located at the 
            Carnegie Melon University. Local programmers would connect by the Internet to the refrigerated 
            appliance, and check to see if there was a drink available and if it was cold, before making the trip.
            By the year 2013, the Internet of Things had evolved into a system using multiple technologies, 
            ranging from the Internet to wireless communication and from micro-electromechanical systems 
            (MEMS) to embedded systems. The traditional fields of automation (including the automation of 
            buildings and homes), wireless sensor networks, GPS, control systems, and others, all support the 
            IoT.
            Kevin Ashton, the Executive Director of Auto-ID Labs at MIT, was the first to describe the Internet 
            of Things, during his 1999 speech. Kevin Ashton stated that Radio Frequency Identification 
            (RFID) was a prerequisite for the Internet of Things. He concluded if all devices were “tagged,” 
            computers could manage, track, and inventory them. To some extent, the tagging of things has 
            been achieved through technologies such as digital watermarking, barcodes, and QR codes. 
            Inventory control is one of the more obvious advantages of the Internet of Things.

            <li><i><b>Improved Customer Engagement</b></i>.Current analytics suffer from blind-spots and 
            significant flaws inaccuracy; and as noted, engagement remains passive. IoT completely 
            transforms this to achieve richer and more effective engagement with audiences.</li>
            <li><i><b>Technology Optimization</b></i>.The same technologies and data which improve the customer 
            experience also improve device use, and aid in more potent improvements to technology. 
            IoT unlocks a world of critical functional and field data.</li>
            <li><i><b>Reduced Waste</b></i>.IoT makes areas of improvement clear. Current analytics give us 
            superficial insight, but IoT provides real-world information leading to the more effective 
            management of resources.</li>
            <li><i><b>Enhanced Data Collection</b></i>.Modern data collection suffers from its limitations and its 
            design for passive use. IoT breaks it out of those spaces and places it exactly where 
            humans really want to go to analyze our world. It allows an accurate picture of everything. </li>

          <ul>
            <li><i><b>Sensing Layer </b></i>. The main purpose of 
              the sensing layer is to identify any 
              phenomena in the devices’ peripheral 
              and obtain data from the real world.</li>
            <li><i><b>Network Layer </b></i>. The network layer acts as a communication channel to transfer data, collected 
              in the sensing layer, to other connected devices. In IoT devices, the network layer is 
              implemented by using diverse communication technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, ZWave, LoRa, cellular network, etc.) to allow data flow between other devices within the same 
              network.</li>
            <li><i><b>Data Processing Layer</b></i>. The data processing layer consists of the main data processing unit 
              of IoT devices. The data processing layer takes data collected in the sensing layer and analyses 
              the data to make decisions based on the result. This layer may share the result of data processing with other 
              connected devices via the network layer</li>
            <li><i><b>Application Layer</b></i>. The application layer implements and presents the results of the data 
              processing layer to accomplish disparate applications of IoT devices. The application layer is a 
              user-centric layer that executes various tasks for the users. There exist diverse IoT applications, 
              which include smart transportation, smart home, personal care, healthcare, etc</li>

  <!--APPLICATION-->
  <section id="application">
    <div class="application">
      <h2> APPLICATION OF IOT</h2>
      <p>The versatile nature of IoT makes it an attractive option for so many businesses, organizations, 
        and government branches, that it doesn’t make sense to ignore it. Here’s a sample of various 
        industries, and how IoT can be best applied.</p>

      
        <ul>
          <li>Agriculture - For indoor planting, IoT makes monitoring and management of micro-climate conditions a reality, which in turn increases production. For outside planting, 
            devices using IoT technology can sense soil moisture and nutrients, in conjunction with 
            weather data, better control smart irrigation and fertilizer systems.
            <br> <br>
            <img src="iot agri.jpg">
          </li>
          <br> <br> <br>
          <li>Consumer Use - For private citizens, IoT devices in the form of wearables and smart homes 
            make life easier. These devices improve entertainment, network 
            connectivity, health, and fitness. Smart homes take care of things like activating 
            environmental controls so that your house is at peak comfort when you come home.
            <br>  <br>
            <img src="iot costumer.jpg">
          </li>
          <br> <br> <br>
          <li>Healthcare - First and foremost, wearable IoT devices let hospitals monitor their patients’ 
            health at home, thereby reducing hospital stays while still providing up to the minute real-time information that could save lives. In hospitals, smart beds keep the staff informed as 
            to the availability, thereby cutting wait time for free space.
            <br> <br>
            <img src="iot healthcrae.jpg">
          </li>
          <br> <br> <br>
          <li>Insurance - Even the insurance industry can benefit from the IoT revolution. Insurance 
            companies can offer their policyholders discounts for IoT wearables such as Fitbit. By 
            employing fitness tracking, the insurer can offer customized policies and encourage 
            healthier habits, which in the long run benefits everyone, insurer, and customer alike.
            <br> <br>
            <img src="iot insurance.jpg">
          </li>
          <br> <br> <br>
          <li>Manufacturing - The world of manufacturing and industrial automation is another big 
            winner in the IoT sweepstakes. RFID and GPS technology can help a manufacturer track a 
            product from its start on the factory floor to its placement in the destination store, the whole 
            supply chain from start to finish. These sensors can gather information on travel time, 
            product condition, and environmental conditions that the product was subjected to.
            <br> <br>
            <img src="iot manufacturing.jpg">
          </li>
          <br> <br> <br>
          <li>Retail - IoT technology has a lot to offer the world of retail. Online and in-store shopping 
            sales figures can control warehouse automation and robotics, information gleaned from IoT 
            sensors. Much of this relies on RFIDs, which are already in heavy use worldwide. Mall 
            locations are iffy things; business tends to fluctuate, and the advent of online shopping has 
            driven down the demand for brick and mortar establishments.
            <br> <br>
            <img src="iot retail.png">
          </li>
          <br> <br> <br>
          <li>Transportation - By this time, most people have heard about the progress being made with 
            self-driving cars. But that’s just one bit of the vast potential in the field of transportation. 
            The GPS, which if you think of it is another example of IoT, is being utilized to help 
            transportation companies plot faster and more efficient routes for trucks hauling freight, 
            thereby speeding up delivery times. There’s already significant progress made in 
            navigation, once again alluding to a phone or car’s GPS. But city planners can also use that 
            data to help determine traffic patterns, parking space demand, and road construction and 
            maintenance.
            <br> <br>

            </li>
            <br> <br> <br>
          <li>Utilities - IoT sensors can be employed to monitor environmental conditions such as 
            humidity, temperature, and lighting. The information provided by IoT sensors can aid in 
            the creation of algorithms that regulate energy usage and make the appropriate adjustments, 
            eliminating the human equation. . With IoT-driven environmental control, 
            businesses and private residences can experience significant energy savings, which in the 
            long run, benefits everyone, including the environment.
