              <h3>What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</h3>
              <p>
                Artificial Intelligence is composed of two words Artificial and Intelligence.
                Artificial defines "man-made," and intelligence defines "thinking power", or “the ability to learn
                and solve problems” hence Artificial Intelligence means "a man-made thinking power."Artificial Intelligence is not a new word and not a new technology for researchers. This technology 
                is much older than you would imagine.

          <h2>HISTORY</h2>
          <br>
          <p><b>A. Maturation of Artificial Intelligence (1943-1952)</b><br>
            <i>➢ The year 1943:</i> The first work which is now recognized as AI was done by Warren 
            McCulloch and Walter pits in 1943. They proposed a model of artificial neurons.<br>
            <i>➢ The year 1949:</i> Donald Hebb demonstrated an updating rule for modifying the 
            connection strength between neurons. His rule is now called Hebbian learning.<br>
            <i>➢ The year 1950:</i> The Alan Turing who was an English mathematician and pioneered 
            Machine learning in 1950. Alan Turing publishes "Computing Machinery and 
            Intelligence" in which he proposed a test. The test can check the machine's ability to 
            exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to human intelligence, called a Turing test.
            <br><br>  <b>B. The birth of Artificial Intelligence (1952-1956)</b>
            <br><i>➢ The year 1955:</i> An Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon created the "first artificial 
            intelligence program" Which was named "Logic Theorist". This program had proved 
            38 of 52 Mathematics theorems, and find new and more elegant proofs for some 
            theorems.
            <br><i>➢ The year 1956:</i> The word "Artificial Intelligence" first adopted by American Computer 
            scientist John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Conference. For the first time, AI coined as 
            an academic field. At that time high-level computer languages such as FORTRAN, 
            LISP, or COBOL were invented. And the enthusiasm for AI was very high at that time.
            <br><br><b> C. The golden years-Early enthusiasm (1956-1974)</b>
            <br><i>➢ The year 1966:</i> The researchers emphasized developing algorithms that can solve 
            mathematical problems. Joseph Weizenbaum created the first chatbot in 1966, which 
            was named as ELIZA.
            <br><i>➢ The year 1972:</i>The first intelligent humanoid robot was built in Japan which was 
            named WABOT-1.
            <br><br><b>D. The first AI winter (1974-1980)</b>
            <br> ➢ The duration between the years 1974 to 1980 was the first AI winter duration. AI winter 
            refers to the time period where computer scientists dealt with a severe shortage of 
            funding from the government for AI researches.
            <br>➢ During AI winters, an interest in publicity on artificial intelligence was decreased.
            <br><br><b>E. A boom of AI (1980-1987)</b>
            <br><i>➢ The year 1980:</i> After AI winter duration, AI came back with "Expert System". Expert 
            systems were programmed that emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert.
            <br>➢ In the Year 1980, the first national conference of the American Association of Artificial 
            Intelligence was held at Stanford University.
            <br><br><b>F. The second AI winter (1987-1993)</b>
            <br>➢ The duration between the years 1987 to 1993 was the second AI Winter duration.
            <br>➢ Again, Investors and government stopped in funding for AI research due to high cost 
            but not efficient results. The expert system such as XCON was very cost-effective.
            <br><br><b>G. The emergence of intelligent agents (1993-2011)</b>
            <br>➢ <i>The year 1997:</i> In the year 1997, IBM Deep Blue beats world chess champion, Gary 
            Kasparov, and became the first computer to beat a world chess champion.
            <br>➢ <i>The year 2002:</i>for the first time, AI entered the home in the form of Roomba, a 
            vacuum cleaner.
            <br>➢<i> The year 2006:</i> AI came into the Business world until the year 2006. Companies like 
            Facebook, Twitter, and Netflix also started using AI.
            <br><br><b>H. Deep learning, big data and artificial general intelligence (2011-present)</b>
            <br>➢ <i>The year 2011:</i> In the year 2011, IBM's Watson won jeopardy, a quiz show, where 
            it had to solve complex questions as well as riddles. Watson had proved that it could 
            understand natural language and can solve tricky questions quickly.
            <br>➢ <i>The year 2012:</i> Google has launched an Android app feature "Google now", which 
            was able to provide information to the user as a prediction.
            <br>➢ <i>The year 2014: </i>In the year 2014, Chatbot "Eugene Goostman" won a competition 
            in the infamous "Turing test."
            <br>➢<i>The year 2018: </i>The "Project Debater" from IBM debated on complex topics with 
            two master debaters and also performed extremely well.
            <br>➢ Google has demonstrated an AI program "Duplex" which was a virtual assistant 
            and which had taken hairdresser appointment on call, and the lady on the other side 
            didn't notice that she was talking with the machine.

     <!-- Advantages and Disadvantages-->

     <section id="advantagesai" class="advantagesai">
      <div class="aicontainer">

            <h3>ADVANTAGE</h3>
           <ul>
              <li><b>High Accuracy with fewer errors:</b> AI machines or systems are prone to fewer errors 
                  and high accuracy as it takes decisions as per pre-experience or information.</li> 
              <li><b>High-Speed:</b> AI systems can be of very high-speed and fast-decision making, because 
                  of that AI systems can beat a chess champion in the Chess game.</li>
              <li><b>High reliability:</b> AI machines are highly reliable and can perform the same action 
                  multiple times with high accuracy.</li>
              <li><b>Useful for risky areas:</b> AI machines can be helpful in situations such as defusing a 
                  bomb, exploring the ocean floor, where to employ a human can be risky.</li>
              <li><b> Digital Assistant:</b> AI can be very useful to provide digital assistant to users such as AI 
                    technology is currently used by various E-commerce websites to show the products as per customer requirements.</li>
              <li><b>Useful as a public utility:</b> AI can be very useful for public utilities such as a self-driving car which can make our journey safer and hassle-free, facial recognition for 
                  security purposes, Natural language processing (for search engines, for spelling 
                  checker, for assistant like Siri, for translation like google translate), etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>DISADVANTAGE</h3>
           <ul>
              <li><b>High Cost:</b> The hardware and software requirement of AI is very costly as it requires lots 
                of maintenance to meet current world requirements.</li>
              <li><b> Can't think out of the box</b> Even we are making smarter machines with AI, but still they 
                cannot work out of the box, as the robot will only do that work for which they are trained, 
                or programmed.
              <li><b>No feelings and emotions:</b> AI machines can be an outstanding performer, but still it does 
                not have the feeling so it cannot make any kind of emotional attachment with humans, and 
                may sometime be harmful for users if the proper care is not taken</li>
              <li><b>Increase dependence on machines:</b> With the increment of technology, people are getting 
                more dependent on devices and hence they are losing their mental capabilities.</li>
              <li><b>No Original Creativity:</b> As humans are so creative and can imagine some new ideas but 
                still AI machines cannot beat this power of human intelligence and cannot be creative and 
                imaginative.</li>

        structured data that corresponds to a formal pattern, such as traditional data sets and databases.
        Also, big data includes semi-structured and unstructured formats, such as word-processing 
        documents, videos, images, audio, presentations, social media interactions, streams, web pages,
